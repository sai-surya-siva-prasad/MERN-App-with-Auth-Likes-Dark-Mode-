Name of the Project: I built a COMPLETE Fullstack Responsive MERN App with Auth, Likes, Dark Mode

Description: I developed a full-stack, responsive MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application. This application includes features like authentication, likes, and a dark mode. I used Material UI for the user interface, Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router for navigation, and MongoDB for the database. I also used other technologies like Redux Persist, React Dropzone, Node, Nodemon, NPX, VsCode, Dotenv, Mongoose, JsonWebToken, Multer, GridFS-Storage, Google Fonts, Formik, and Yup.

Technologies Being Used:

Frontend: Material UI, Redux Toolkit, React Router, Redux Persist, React Dropzone
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JsonWebToken, Multer, GridFS-Storage
Other: Nodemon, NPX, VsCode, Dotenv, Google Fonts, Formik, Yup
What I Learned: The project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how to build a full-stack MERN application from scratch. I learned how to set up the backend with Node, Visual Studio Code, and various backend packages. I also learned how to configure middleware and set up MongoDB. I gained knowledge about data modeling and ER diagrams, and implemented authentication and authorization in Node. I set up user and post routes and added data to the backend. On the frontend, I installed and set up React, Redux, and other necessary packages. I also set up the file and folder architecture and React Router. I learned how to install and set up Redux and Toolkit, and how to set up color, theme, dark mode, and styling. I created a navbar and register, login pages, and forms. I also built a home page with widgets, posts, post widgets, and a profile page. This project allowed me to build a complete full-stack MERN application from scratch.
